[ Bird Chirping ]
[ Insects Buzzing,
Chittering ]
[ Gasps ]
No, no, no.
Oh, no. Oh, no.
I'm lost!
Where's the line?
It just went away.
What do I do?
- Help!
- We'll be stuck here forever!
Do not panic.
Do not panic!
We are trained professionals.
Now, stay calm.
We are going around the leaf.
A-Around the leaf?
I don't think we can do that.
Oh, nonsense. This is nothing
compared to the twig of'93.
- [ Whimpering ]
- That's it. That's it. Good!
You're doing great
There you go. There you go!
Watch my eyes.
Don't look awy.
- And here'sthe line again.
- Thank you Thank you, Mr. Soil.
[ Laughing]
Good job, everybody!
Oh, my.
There's quite a gap, Mr. Soil.
- Shouldn't we tell the queen?
- I don't think we need
to involve the queen in this.
She's got enough on her plate already,
training her daughter.
Oh, yes.
Princess Atta, the poor dear.
Oh, wind's died down.
They'll be here soon.
-Just be confident, dear.
You'll be fine.
- [ Gasps ] There's a gap.

There's a gap in the line.

What are we gonna do?

It's okay, Your Highness. Gaps happen.

We just lost a few inches, that's all.

Oh. Right.

Your Highness, I can't count

when you hover like that.

Oh, of course.

I'm sorry. Go ahead.

- Guys, go shade

someone else for a while.

- [ Pet Chirps ]

Okay, Atta.

Now what do we do?

Ahh-- Oh! Don't tell me.

I know it. What is it?

- We relax.

- [ Chuckles ] Right.

Oh, it'll be fine.

It's the same, year after year.

They come, they eat, they leave.

That's our lot in life.

It's not a lot, but it's our life.

[ Laughs ]

[ Chuckles ]

Isn't that right, Aphie?

Oh, you're such a cute little aphid.

[ Rumbling ]

- Ditch Dot!

- Yeah, yeah!

Hey, come back here!

[ Strains, Grunts ]

- Dot!

- Yes, Mother.

What did I tell you

about trying to fly?

Not until my wings grow in.

- Right.

- But Mom--

Dot, you're a young queen ant

and your wings are too little--

I was talking to Mother.

You're not the queen yet, Atta.

Now, Dot,

be nice to your sister.

It's not my fault

she's so stressed out.

[ Sighs ]

I know, I know.

- I'm always acting

like the sky is falling.

- Look out!

- Atta!

- Princess Atta!

- Oh!

- Hey!

-Stop that!

- What do you think you're doing?

- You could have killed

somebody over here.

- [ Gasps ] I'm sorry!

- Oh, it's Flik.

- Oh--

I'm sorry, I'm sorry,

I'm sorry, I'm so sorry!

- Please forgive me. I'm sorry!

- [ Coughing ]

- [ Screams ] Princess Atta!

- Flik, what are you doing?

Oh, this! This is my new idea

for harvesting grain.

No more picking individual kernels.

You cut down the entire stalk!

- We don't have time for this.

- Exactly! We never have time

to collect food for ourselves.

We spend all summer

harvesting for the offering.

- But my invention will

speed up production.

- Oh, another invention?

Something for you too.

Since you're gonna be queen, you could

use this to oversee production.

- Dr. Flora, if I may.

- This is all very nice, but--

-Just an ordinary blade of grass

and a bead of dew, right?

- Flik, please.

- Wrong! It is, in fact, a telescope.

- [ Both Laugh ]

- It's very clever, Flik, but--

- Hello, Princess! Aren't you

looking lovely this morning!

Not that you would need

a telescope to see that.

Listen! The princess doesn't

have time for this!

You wanna help fill this thing?

Get rid of that machine,

get back in line and pick grain

like everybody else!

- Like everybody else!

- Please, Flik. Just go.

I'm sorry,

I was really just trying--

trying to help.

Harvester. Why, we harvested

the same way ever since I was a pupa.
